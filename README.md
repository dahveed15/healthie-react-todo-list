# Todo List App

This is a frontend-only todo list app featuring a drag-and-drop interface and persistent local storage. The app includes three columns, (**Todo**, **Doing**, and **Done**) and allows users to add, move, and reorder tasks with ease. When a task is moved into the **Done** column, a **confetti explosion** celebrates your accomplishment.
